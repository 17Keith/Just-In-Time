This is the server-side of JIT, which is being built to enable people to post packages, documents and other necessary goods that they want delivered. 

The back-end is still not complete, some endpoints need to be created, (like postPackage and deliveryLocation,) to make sure it is fully functional. 

The code language used is JavaScript (Node.js and Express) and the DataBase is MongoDB. 

More details will be added, as the back-end is coming to shape.
